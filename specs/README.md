# Feature Specs Overview

This directory captures working specifications for the `evm-tui` Ratatui application. Update the relevant spec whenever you ship a significant behavior change or adjust pane layout; keep the overview aligned with `AGENTS.md` guidelines.

## Current Specs
- `top_section.md` – header title, search, and settings surface.
- `sidebar.md` – favorites sidebar tabs and chain labeling rules.
- `main_view.md` – address and transaction detail panes, including debugging flows.
- `bottom_bar.md` – keyboard help rendering and adaptive tips.

Add new files if additional features (e.g., settings modal, analytics) need dedicated coverage.
